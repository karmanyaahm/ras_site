# Robotathon

Robotathon is a fall semester introductory robotics competition, created and run by the UT IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS). We teach the basics of robotics to those new to the field.

About 50-100 participants are placed in teams of 4-5 people, assigned a mentor, and helped through designing and building a robot. You'll then compete amongst your peers for everlasting glory! You can only compete once (no Robotathon veterans, please).

Many people get started with robots and RAS by participating in Robotathon. But if this isn't your cup of tea, [join us]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact.html) instead for [something for everyone]({{ site.baseurl }}/about.html).


## Fall 2019

#### Last year's competition

Last year's theme was RASketball! The competition was a points based game where robots must navigate an obstacle course using line and wall following, and nab the basketball from the center before the other team! **The 2019 rules can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JeT-uYuNqRIlYnmf7Sh_QjKjcQatjANzEfbl8RbqX1Y/edit?usp=sharing).**

For historical purposes, you might also be interested in [the 2017 year's rules]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/about/robotathon/2017/robotathon_rules_2017.pdf)! The 2018 rules will be posted on a later date.

#### FAQ

##### So what is Robotathon?

Robotathon is an annual event held every fall semester at the University of Texas at Austin by the [UT IEEE Robotics and Automation Society]({{ site.baseurl }}/index.html) (RAS [_răz_]).
This competition is a two month long bootcamp for robotics culminating in a large, sports-like competition that pits each teams' robot against each the others in a tournament style battle-to-the-death (metaphorical) for glory and honor (and bragging rights).
It is designed for [newcomers]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/robotathon.html#what-do-i-need-to-know-to-participate) only. However, if you're a veteran at robotics, you might be interested in one of our other [committees]({{ site.baseurl }}/about.html).

##### What are the robots like?

We provide a basic electronics kit: servo motors, battery pack, and TI LM4F LaunchPad microcontroller. Teams generally use the resources available in the <a href='http://makerspace.engr.utexas.edu/'>UT makerspace</a>, including 3D printers and laser cutters, to build the robot frame and mechanics. You can see some of the 2016 robots <a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/ut_ieee_ras/sets/72157679713279342'>here</a>!

##### When does Robotathon happen?

<div style="color:red;">
    Applications are currently closed. Please consider signing up to our newsletter, or joining one of our other committees, like Demobots or Region V, if you want to learn and do robotics.
</div>

Participants apply to Robotathon at the beginning of the fall semester. Teams are formed by the Robotathon kickoff meeting, paired with a mentor, and taught basic robotics through weekly workshops up until the competition itself, which is Tuesday, November 16, 2019, 10am-2pm, at Mulva Auditorium.

##### What do I need to know to participate?

Absolutely nothing! All you need is a open mind and a desire to learn. While this is a competition, it is also, above all, a learning experience designed to help teach robotics to those that want to learn. In addition, all participants are generally on the same level because this competition is restricted to newcomers to RAS - primarily freshmen!

##### Who can compete?

UT undergraduates can apply (you don't have to be an engineer!). Over 50 students are selected and formed into teams of about 4 people. Furthermore, any one person can only ever compete in one Robotathon (not both 2018 and 2019, say): do your best!

##### What is the time commitment like?

It's up to you. However, the quality of your robot often depends directly on the amount of time you and your team work on it. For best results, expect to spend 5 to 10 hours per week in workshops or actual design and construction. If your other obligations prevent you from collaborating with your team, please inform your mentor and your team and appropriate arrangements will be made.

##### I can't make some event! What do I do?

Make sure you can attend the Robotathon kickoff meeting (evening of Tuesday, September 24) and Robotathon itself (noon of November 16). As long as your team members can make any particular workshop, you'll stay caught up. Make sure to meet with your team as often as possible!

##### How do I sign up?

Registration is open in the beginning of the fall semester. You need to pay general member dues ($15) and Robotathon dues ($20)! General member dues can be paid with our new [TXShop link](https://bit.ly/2kbrGWL), Robotathon dues must be paid <b>in cash</b> to a leader before or at Kickoff. You also need to sign a safety waiver. Dues may be paid after any RAS general meeting or during RAS office hours.
