# Demobots

### Meetings:
* **Fridays  5:00-6:30 PM** (via Zoom)

We're the non-competitive committee (mostly) in RAS, and if you've seen a couch drive by on campus, you've seen us!

We work on a bunch of different projects headed by many members of RAS, including:

* The Couchbot (Expecting to be recommissioned in Late February!)

* Polargraph Drawing Machine

* Dancebot

Interested members can propose their own project, and can use RAS resources to bring it to fruition. If you have a great idea, pitch it to Demobots and make a team!

Beginners are recommended to join, as we teach all skills necessary. We are in particular need of Mechanical, Electrical, Computer and CS majors.

We also make the occasional [blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog.html).

Try looking for us at your nearest UT showcase. Demobots is the more public arm of the group, and you can find us demoing our robots at events such as Gone to Engineering, Edison Lectures, Girl Day, and Explore UT.
