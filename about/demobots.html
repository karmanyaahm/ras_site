# Demobots

### **Meetings**
* **Mondays  6:00-7:00 PM** (EER 1.504)

### **What is Demobots?**

Demobots is where the non-competitive bots of RAS are created. Demobots doesn’t have the harsh deadlines that a lot of the competition teams do; we focus on making fun robots and improving the bots we already have (like Couchbot! One of our longest Demobots projects) 

### **Current Demobots projects**
* **Couch Bot:** a couch that can drive around via a joystick!
* **Talons of Acquisition:** a claw machine bot 
* **Fetch bot:** a bot that can catch a ball thrown at it 
* **Dance bot Mothership:** a “mothership” robot that carries smaller robots and then deploys them to perform synchronized dances

### **Fetch your own ideas!**
We love new robots so if you have a wacky new idea it could become the next demobot!!
All experience levels are welcome as there are always new tasks to focus on in the variety of Demobots sub-committees. Look for us at the next UT Engineering event or contact us through the "Demobots" discord channel!
