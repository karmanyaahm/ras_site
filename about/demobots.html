<h2>Demobots</h2>

<h5>Meetings: <b>F 5-6:30 PM (EER Makerspace 2nd Floor Robotics Room), Su 1-2:30 PM (EER 0.822)</b></h5>

<p>We're the non-competitive committee (mostly) in RAS, and if you've seen a couch drive by on campus you've met us before.</p>
<p>We work on a bunch of different projects headed by many members of RAS, including:
    <ul>
        <li>The Couch</li>
        <li>Autonomous Vehicle Projec (IGVC)</li>
        <li>Polargraph Drawing Machine</li>
        <li>Dancebot</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Interested members can propose their own project, and can use RAS resources to bring it to fruition. If you have a great idea, pitch it to Demobots and make a team!</p>
<p>Beginners are recommended to join, as we teach all skills necessary. We are in particular need of Mechanical, Electrical, Computer and CS majors.</p>
<p>For the IGVC team, we recommend having prior experience in robotics.</p>
<p>We do also make the occasional <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog.html">blog post</a>.

<p>Try looking for us at your nearest UT showcase. We're usually the part of RAS that showcases the work we've done at events such as Girl Day or Explore UT.</p>
