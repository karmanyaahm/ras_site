<h2>Micromouse</h2>

<h5>Meetings: <b>Sa 8 PM (EER 0.822)</b></h5>

<p>We make the tiny robots in RAS; bite-sized "mice" that race around with the zoomies. We prep for an annual competition down in California where we compete with other university students to explore and traverse a maze the fastest.</p>
<p>Check us out if you want to do:
    <ul>
        <li>Board level and power/sensor system design</li>
        <li>High speed control loops</li>
        <li>Pathfinding and simulation</li>
        <li>Electronics testing, soldering, and PCB design</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Students with previous robotics experience are recommended to join.</p>
