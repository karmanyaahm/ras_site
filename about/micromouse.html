# Micromouse

### Meetings:
* **Sa 8:00 PM** (EER 0.822)

We make the tiny robots in RAS; bite-sized "mice" that race around with the zoomies. We prep for an annual competition down in California where we compete with other university students to explore and traverse a maze the fastest.

Check us out if you want to do:
* Board level and power/sensor system design
* High speed control loops
* Pathfinding, mazesolving, and control loops
* Electronics testing, SMD soldering, and PCB design

Students with previous robotics experience are highly recommended to join.
