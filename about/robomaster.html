# RoboMaster

We build small human controlled robots to compete in an annual competition called RoboMaster by DJI. The compeition changes slightly year to year but revolves around creating small robots that can shoot balls at opposing robots to decrease their damage and copmlete objectives for points. You can check more about the compeition [here](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US).

The competition requries skills from all areas of robotics and we could always use more help. If you're interested in hardware design and CAD, hardware manufacturing, electronics and PCB design, or software development come check us out.

You can do so by joining our slack channel `#robomaster` located on the [UT RAS slack](utras.slack.com) and message me (@Josh) if you're interested. If you're lazy you can also just email me at jspspike@gmail.com.
