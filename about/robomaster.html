### **RoboMaster Competition**

RoboMaster combines elements of League of Legends and an FPS game along with robotics and engineering. Two teams put 3 robots out on the field, each with a different set of abilities, and a goal of taking down the other team’s base. In order to win, robots shoot plastic pellets at the opposing team’s robots and base. 

RoboMaster is unlike any other collegiate-level robotics competition. Not only does the competition challenge students to build both autonomous and driver-controlled robots, but it also allows teams the opportunity to construct drones. Teams use industry-standard programs like Keil and CAD software, allowing students to gain more practical experience in their respective engineering field of study. RoboMaster is also a very new competition in the United States, which allows us to greatly impact its future.
