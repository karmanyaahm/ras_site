# CURM (Deprecated)
## The Convention for Unconventional Robotic Movement
<b style="color: red;">This page is for archival purposes only.</b>

<br/>

### <b> What is CURM? </b>

CURM was an annual robotics convention held at the University of Texas at Austin by the UT Robotics and Automation Society (RAS). It was open to anyone that would like to participate, including but not limited to UT students. In preparation for the competition, participants - individually or as part of a team - built robots that move unconventionally. On event day, participants showcased their efforts, research, and robots through presentations and small competitions. 

CURM was last held on <u>Saturday, April 27th, 2019.</u> The former rules can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ToDi-gkUYjEKn-nCvRlUlK9y3Rn7svcyLzwhAepvIp0/edit?usp=sharing).

### <b> Frequently Asked Questions </b>

##### Do I have to be a UT student to participate/attend?

No, CURM is open to anyone. If you would like to participate, all you have to do is fill out the interest form. If you just want to attend, no registration is required.

##### I don't have much experience with robotics? How can I build a robot?

If you are a UT student, there are a variety of resources on campus. Come to the RAS Office (EER TBD) and ask a leader how you can get started. If you are not a UT student, look for a robotics organization or a maker space that can help you with your project. There are also a variety of resources online to help you get started in robotics. Feel free to email us if you would like more information.

##### I have an idea, but I don't know if it is unconventional. How can I tell?

Unconventional is however you define it. Generally, we advise people to avoid using actuated wheels for locomotion; however, there are unconventional ways to use wheels too, so this rule is not perfect. Do some research to find out if someone else has done it before. Even if your idea is similar, implementing it is a unique way can make a great entry.

##### I have another project that deals with robotic movement that I think would qualify. Can I enter it even if it wasn't built specifically for CURM2018?

Yes, as long as it is your own creation, you can share it at CURM.

##### Can I bring more than one entry?

Yes, the more robots we have, the better. Nevertheless, we would like to stress quality over quantity.

##### What are the meet and greet events?

Over the few months leading up to CURM, we will be having some social events where people working on CURM entries can come and talk about their ideas. People that need help with their projects can come ask for advice. More experienced roboticists will be there to talk about their entries. Check the facebook group for announcements regarding these events.
