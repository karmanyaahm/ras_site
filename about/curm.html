## The Convention for Unconventional Robotic Movement

<div class="alert alert-dark">Register for CURM 2018 <a class="alert-link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WB7WCXjI_tuYHj9_wSRFHJA9rIMrsAbpsFeiw0TbERM/viewform?edit_requested=true">here</a>!</div>

#### CURM 2018 is April 15, 2018 (location TBD)!

#### About

CURM is an annual robotics convention held at the University of Texas at
Austin by the UT Robotics and Automation Society (RAS). It is open to
anyone that would like to participate, including but not limited to UT
students. In preparation for the competition, participants - individually
or as part of a team - build robots that move unconventionally. On the
event day, participants will showcase their efforts, resarch, and robots
through presentations and small competitions.

We will have some minor social events prior to the main convention. If
you are in the Austin area, feel free to come by and meet other CURM
participants.

#### Rules

Old 2016 CURM Rules are [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/about/curm/curm_rules_2016.pdf) - new 2018 rules will be out soon (but should be similar)!

#### Competition

The competition will be held in the late 2018 spring semester, date and location TBD.
Come show off your robot or watch the competition!

#### Frequently Asked Questions

##### Do I have to be a UT student to participate/attend?

No, CURM 2018 is open to anyone. If you would like to participate, all
you have to do is fill out the interest form. If you just want to attend,
no registration is required.

##### I don't have much experience with robotics? How can I build a robot?

If you are a UT student, there are a variety of resources on campus. Come
to the RAS Office (EER TBD) and ask a leader how you can get started. If
you are not a UT student, look for a robotics organization or a maker
space that can help you with your project. There are also a variety of
resources online to help you get started in robotics. Feelfree to email
us if you would like more information.

##### I have an idea, but I don't know if it is unconventional. How can I tell?

Unconventional is however you define it. Generally, we advise people to avoid
using actuated wheels for locomotion; however, there are unconventional ways to
use wheels too, so this rule is not perfect. Do some research to find out if
someone else has done it before. Even if your idea is similar, implementing it
is a unique way can make a great entry.

##### I have another project that deals with robotic movement that I think would qualify. Can I enter it even if it wasn't built specifically for CURM2018?

Yes, as long as it is your own creation, you can share it at CURM2016.

##### Can I bring more than one entry?

Yes, the more robots we have, the better. Nevertheless, we would like
to stress quality over quantity.

##### What are the meet and greet events?

Over the few months leading up to CURM, we will be having some social events
where people working on CURM entries can come and talk about their ideas. People
that need help with their projects can come ask for advice. More experienced
roboticists will be there to talk about their entries. Check the facebook group
for announcements regarding these events.
