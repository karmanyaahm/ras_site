# RoboSub

### Meetings:
* **Wednesday 6:00 PM** (EER)
* **Saturday 1:00 PM** (EER)

Times and locations sometimes change and are always updated on the `#robosub` channel on our [slack](utras.slack.com).

We create underwater autonomous robots to compete in an annual collegiate competition. The competition involves completing different challengs for points. You can learn more about the competition [here](https://robosub.org/) and you can see what we're up to [here](http://ras.ece.utexas.edu/blog.html).

Check us out if you want to do:
* Electronics and PCB design
* CAD, hardware design and manufacturing
* Sensor control loops for autonomous control
* Machine learning image recognition

Students with previous robotics experience are highly recommended to join.
