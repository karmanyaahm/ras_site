We're the friendly neighborhood competitive robot committee which has done a bunch of cool things, including a token collecting and sorting bot and a set of swarmbots.

In the academic year 2019-2020, we planned to compete in a litter competition - we needed to build a robot that picks up and sorts trash, as well as try to stop a litterbug from littering!

<i style="color: blue;">Due to COVID-19, we have disbanded the group for the foreseeable future and are repurposing our robot for the Demobots Dancebot group. Please check our blog posts [here](https://ras.ece.utexas.edu/2020/05/01/region5.html) talking about our work this year and the state of the robot.</i>

We work on a bunch of different systems in order to create a competitive robot. We highly recommend you check us out if you are interested in:

* CAD (Solidworks) and rapid prototyping

* Sensor fusion

* Path finding

* Object recognition and vision processing

* Python for software and firmware

* Electronics testing, soldering, and PCB design

* Software Defined Radio

Beginners are highly recommended to join, as we teach all skills necessary. We are in particular need of Mechanical, Electrical, Computer and CS majors.

We also make the occasional [blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog.html).
