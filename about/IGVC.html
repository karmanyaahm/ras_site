# IGVC

##### What do we do?

We build an autonomous robot that must navigate through an obstacle course. There are a multitude of components that go into the construction of the robot. Whether that’s electrical, software, or mechanical components, there is surely an aspect of the team that will interest you.

##### When do we meet?

Fridays 5:00 PM (via Zoom)

##### Who can sign up for the team?

Anyone can sign up! Regardless of your background, we can teach you everything you need to know about the robot and what you’re interested in.

##### Does this team compete?

Yes! From June 4-7, 2021 we will be competing in Detroit at the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition.

If I would like to learn more about the competition, where can I find more information?
