IGVC 2/15/2022



IGVCâ€™s goals for the semester are to be working in the machine shop to finish up assembly for the robot. Whether that means machining the necessary sprockets or machining retaining ring slots, IGVC will be finishing that up so assembly can be completed as soon as possible.

On the software side of things, we will be ensuring every sensor is fully calibrated. So the LiDAR, GPS, and camera should all be fully functional and ready to be programmed.

We will be meeting in the EER Makerspace in the R&A Room at Fridays at 5 pm. Hope to see you all there!
