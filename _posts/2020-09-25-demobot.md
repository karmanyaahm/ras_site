This semester has certainly been an unusual one for Demobots. Despite its unorthodox structure this year with meetings taking place on Zoom and collaboration occurring primarily online, many exciting things are taking place in Demobots! <!--more-->

##### For starters:

There’s a new Demobot in town. RAS’s newest addition to the non-competitive robot teams is a claw machine. The goal of this project is not only to build and improve upon the mechanisms of a classic machine but also to eventually add on unique features such as a motion-controlled claw or a “bird's eye view” mode, where the player operates the claw from a camera suspended above the prize pit. The claw machine mechanism will also be used in creating the “deployment method” of the mothership for the DanceBot Swarm demobots team. To read more about DanceBot check out their blog post!

The team is currently working on designing the mechanism, modeling it in CAD software, and deciding on a circuitry design, and actively looking for members for the “electrical” team.

##### Couchbot:

Since the start of the semester Couchbot team has been working on a variety of projects to make the beloved Couchbot even more functional and exciting! Couchbot has also been hosting tutorials and workshops for skills related to Couchbot's future plans as well as general “good-to-know” information. Some of their workshops so far have covered things like making apps with Android studio, using Linux/Git, and programming in Python.

As always, if you're interested in joining Demobots, join the MS Teams (or utras.slack.com) demobots group or send me a message at cmonty@utexas.edu.
